# Messaging demo with spring and activemq

To build a proper activemq, edit or set the variables
in [./build-activemq-image.cmd](./build-activemq-image.cmd) and run it.

You can pass optionally a proxy url as first parameter.

After that you can run `docker-compose uÂ´ within the root to start a container with the just created
image

For more details see
the [Artemis Documentation](https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/documentation/)
